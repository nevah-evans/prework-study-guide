        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li><strong>Inline CSS</strong>: Styles elements directly in the HTML file using specific tags and style attributes with CSS rule for a particular page element.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal CSS Style Sheet</strong>: Embeds an entire style sheet directly in the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element.</li>
          <li><strong>External CSS Style Sheet</strong>: The most common way to style a webpage. CSS rules are in a separate file, using a "link" element placed in the HTML's "head".</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS <em>property</em> we want to apply and the <em>value</em> of the property.</li>
          <li>Two selectors can follow the same CSS rule when using a comma. (EX. header,footer).</li>
